class ElysiaChainOfThought(Module):
    """
    A custom reasoning DSPy module that reasons step by step in order to predict the output of a task.
    It will automatically include the most relevant inputs:
    - The user's prompt
    - The conversation history
    - The atlas
    - Any errors (from calls of the same tool)

    And you can also include optional inputs (by setting their boolean flags on initialisation to `True`):
    - The environment
    - The collection schemas
    - The tasks completed

    You can also specify `collection_names` to only include certain collections in the collection schemas.

    It will optionally output (by setting the boolean flags on initialisation to `True`):
    - The reasoning (model step by step reasoning)
    - A message update (if `message_update` is `True`), a brief 'update' message to the user.
    - Whether the task is impossible (boolean)

    You can use this module by calling the `.aforward()` method, passing all your *new* inputs as keyword arguments.
    You do not need to include keyword arguments for the other inputs, like the `environment`.

    Example:
    ```python
    my_module = ElysiaChainOfThought(
        signature=...,
        tree_data=...,
        message_update=True,
        environment=True,
        collection_schemas=True,
        tasks_completed=True,
    )
    my_module.aforward(input1=..., input2=..., lm=...)
    ```

        Args:
            signature (Type[dspy.Signature]): The signature of the module.
            tree_data (TreeData): Required. The tree data from the Elysia decision tree.
                Used to input the current state of the tree into the prompt.
                If you are using this module as part of a tool, the `tree_data` is an input to the tool call.
            reasoning (bool): Whether to include a reasoning input (chain of thought).
            impossible (bool): Whether to include a boolean flag indicating whether the task is impossible.
                This is useful for stopping the tree from continuing and returning to the base of the decision tree.
                For example, the model judges a query impossible to execute, or the user has not provided enough information.
            message_update (bool): Whether to include a message update input.
                If True, the LLM output will include a brief 'update' message to the user.
                This describes the current action the LLM is performing.
                Designed to increase interactivity and provide the user with information before the final output.
            environment (bool): Whether to include an environment input.
                If True, the module will include the currently stored data from previous tasks and actions into the prompt.
                This is useful so that the LLM knows what has already been done, and can avoid repeating actions.
                Or to use information from the environment to perform the new action.
            collection_schemas (bool): Whether to include a collection schema input.
                If True, the module will include the preprocessed collection schemas in the prompt input.
                This is useful so that the LLM knows the structure of the collections, if querying or similar.
                Use this sparingly, as it will use a large amount of tokens.
                You can specify `collection_names` to only include certain collections in this schema.
            tasks_completed (bool): Whether to include a tasks completed input.
                If True, the module will include the list of tasks completed input.
                This is a nicely formatted list of the tasks that have been completed, with the reasoning for each task.
                This is used so that the LLM has a 'stream of consciousness' of what has already been done,
                as well as to stop it from repeating actions.
                Other information is included in the `tasks_completed` field that format outputs from previous tasks.
                This is useful for continuing a decision logic across tasks, or to reinforce key information.
            collection_names (list[str]): A list of collection names to include in the prompt.
                If provided, this will modify the collection schema input to only include the collections in this list.
                This is useful if you only want to include certain collections in the prompt.
                And to reduce token usage.
            **config: The DSPy configuration for the module.
